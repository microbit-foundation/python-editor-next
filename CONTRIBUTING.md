Thanks for looking here! We'd love your help. The micro:bit project is only
possible through contributions of companies and individuals around the world.

This project is managed on GitHub, and the best way to contribute is to jump in
and fix/file issues.

If you're interested in working on any of these items, please file an issue
and mention @microbit-matt-hillsdon

Significant features are best discussed first to make sure everyone is agreed
on the best direction.
