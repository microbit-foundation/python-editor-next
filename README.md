# micro:bit Python Editor V3

This project is a web-based code editor that targets the [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) version of the [Python programming language](http://python.org/).

Code written with this editor is expected to run on the [BBC micro:bit device](https://microbit.org).

Try it out at https://python.microbit.org/

## Previous versions

For more background about how this editor relates to the original Python Editor project, see [this explanation](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor/issues/391).

The V2 editor project is still available at https://python.microbit.org/v/2 and its source code can be found in GitHub at https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor.

## Building and running the editor

We've written a [technical overview](./docs/tech-overview.md) that's a good starting point for working on the Python Editor or for using ideas and components from the app in other projects. We'd love to hear from you if you're making use of this project. You can get in touch via [support](https://support.microbit.org/).

Getting up and running:

1. Ensure you have a working [Node.js environment](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend using the LTS version of Node and NPM version 8 or newer.
2. Checkout this repository with Git. GitHub have some [learning resources for Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) that you may find useful.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` on the command line in the checkout folder.
4. Choose from the NPM scripts documented below. Try `npm start` if you're not sure.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

This does not show TypeScript or lint errors.
Use the eslint plugin for your editor and consider also running `npm run typecheck:watch` to see full type checking errors.

### `npm test`

Launches the [test runner](https://vitest.dev/) in interactive mode (unless the `CI` environment variable is defined).
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

If you have a connected micro:bit device, then setting the environment variable `TEST_MODE_DEVICE=1` will enable additional tests that will connect to your micro:bit. The tests will overwrite programs and data on the micro:bit.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode running the end to end tests.

These are excluded from the normal test run.

The tests expect the app to already be running on http://localhost:3000, for example via `npm start`.

We use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and the helpers provided by [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/pptr-testing-library/intro/).

The CI tests run these end-to-end tests against a production build.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Deployments

Most users should use the supported Foundation deployment at https://python.microbit.org/

The editor is deployed by [GitHub actions](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/python-editor-v3/actions).

The `main` branch is deployed to https://python.microbit.org/v/beta on each push.

Other branches (e.g. for PRs) are deployed to https://review-python-editor-v3.microbit.org/{branch}. Special characters in the branch name are replaced by hyphens. Deployments will not run in forks.

Binaries for MicroPython are included for micro:bit V1 ([license](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/blob/master/LICENSE)) and micro:bit V2 ([license](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/micropython-microbit-v2/blob/master/LICENSE)). Both are MIT licensed.

Python diagnostics and autocomplete use a fork of Microsoft's Pyright type checker which has been [modified by us](public/workers/PYRIGHT_README.txt) to run as a Web Worker. Pyright is Â© Microsoft Corporation and [used under an MIT license](public/workers/PYRIGHT_LICENSE.txt).

We use dependencies via the NPM registry as specified by the package.json file under common Open Source licenses.
